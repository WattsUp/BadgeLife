## ID Holder - 2019 ##
This is a holder I made for my ID badge at work. It is non functional and purely aesthetic. Overall it has an RF theme with trace antennae (including a Sierpinski fractal antenna), a trace capacitor, microstrip impedance matching networks, and a region where I played the game snake.

Mechanically, I am impressed by the clips machined out of the PCB that work amazing the first try. They assembly procedure could use improvement due to warping. Currently three boards are reflowed together to form a sandwich.
